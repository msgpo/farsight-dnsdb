## Farsight DNSDB Integration Options


### API Key

In order to use the DNDSDB API, you must have a valid DNSDB API key. Which will be provided to you after your purchase Farsight DNSDB. For more information on Farisght's DNSDB, please visit:

### Blacklist

This is an alternate option that can be used to specify domains that you do not want sent to Domain Tools. The data needs to be `comma` separated in order to work appropriately. As a user if you want to blacklist a whole top level such as ".com" you can do so by adding `,.com`.

### Lookup Options

Each user has the ability to determine if they want to lookup IPs or Domains.
